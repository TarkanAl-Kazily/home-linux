I believe that I originally followed this guide when setting up my Graphics:

I did not then disable this guide.

Next, I used Optimus Manager to enable switching between Intel and Nvidia graphics.

Today (2020_07_23) I am removing these settings to try using the NVIDIA supported PRIME Graphics management system.

However, the NVIDIA supported graphics may be broken with Linux kernel 5.4+

Going to try using Optimus Manager to control the Optimus settings (since that worked in the past) and use that to manually swap between cards.
